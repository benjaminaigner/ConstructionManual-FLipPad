FLipPad Construction Manual

# Software

* Scribus for the page layout
* FreeCAD for the PCB & case renderings

## FreeCAD Plugins

Due to different extra features we need, some new workbenches (addons) must be installed to FreeCAD:

* __Render:__ Install this workbench via the integrated addon manager (Tools -> Addon manager)
* __Animate:__ Currently (02/2022), the animate workbench has to be installed manually: https://jirivalasek.github.io/Animate/Guide/getting_started.html
